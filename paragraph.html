This code defines a simple Login component in React that allows users to enter their email and password and submit the form. It uses the useState hook to manage form data, ensuring that the input fields are controlled components. When the user types into the fields, the state variables (email and password) are updated in real time. On form submission, the handleSubmit function prevents the default page reload and logs the entered credentials to the console. While it currently only prints the values, this setup provides a foundation for integrating backend authentication using Axios or other APIs. The component demonstrates how React can be used to build interactive, state-driven forms and can be expanded later with features such as error handling, form validation, and navigation to the dashboard upon successful login
